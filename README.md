# SynOS
Wasting my time on a C++ OS.

SynOS isn't ready for anything yet.
But I have a few pretty cool ideas for it's design!

Like a very modular and pedantic Microkernel-Design with fine grained IPC interface.
The good thing: You can write System Modules in any language you want, you just need 
to implement the IPC interface.

I want to implement a dtrace like interface and other scriptable analysis tools. (In a few years maybe)

The user interface won't be a typical shell, more a interactive usable Python REPL with direct connection
to the running System Modules.
